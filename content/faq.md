### Can I walk the race?
The Hopton 10K is a running race in which participants should make best efforts to complete the course within a 2 hour cut-off point. We encourage everyone to run as much as possible in order to avoid the cut-off time. A sweeper team will follow the route to remove signs and clean-up any rubbish; they will take around 2 hours to complete the route.

Absolutely! Please use this opportunity to raise sponsorship, and we would be delighted if you would consider running the race in support of our good cause - Hopton Primary School.

There will be a fully equipped medical treatment centre at the start/finish line and emergency vehicle and mobile medic available. We do not suggest anyone runs if they are feeling unwell. Please declare any known/pre-existing medical conditions when you register for the race and display this information clearly on your race number before you run. 

### Can I help if I am not running the race?

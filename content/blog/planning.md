# Latest preparations

## Short Road Closure
There way still be three months to go before the Hopton10k but preparations are in full swing. We've had confirmation that we can temporarily close Calder Road, Granny Lane and Stenard Lane for twenty minutes between 10:00 and 10:20. This will allow the start of the race to be completely car free, I'd expect all runners to have entered the woods by 10:15.

## Parking
We have secured additional parking for around twenty cars at Lower Hopton WMC. The car park is just a minutes walk from school and will take the number of official parking places available on the day to around 70.

## Sponsors
We are still accepting sponsors for the race. If you are interested in getting involved and supporting us please [get in touch]('/contact/')
